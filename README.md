# Simple_NN

Small python 3 project written as a stepping stone for learning the basics of convolution neural networks for another repo [Pykadex](www.github.com/sudini1412/Pykadex). The project uses 10,000 images of cats and dogs downloaded from bing and uses them to train a simple nueral network. I have tried to write the class as flexible as possible so that it can be used to test any two category of images not just cats and dogs.

## for running the program
```bash
foo@bar:~$ python3 -W ignore run.py
```
## for downloading traing data
```bash
foo@bar:~$ pip3 install bing_image_downloader==1.0.2
```
```bash
foo@bar:~$ pip3 show bing_image downloader
```

open the dir in which the bing_imaage_downloader is stored in and replace the bing.py file with replacement_bing1-0-2.py.
